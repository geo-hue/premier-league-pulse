# Backend Developer Role Document – Premier League Pulse

This document outlines the role of the Backend Developer within the Premier League Pulse project. It provides an in-depth overview of responsibilities, technical requirements, deliverables, and integration points with other roles to ensure smooth collaboration and high-quality outcomes.

---

## 1. Role Overview

The Backend Developer is responsible for implementing and maintaining the server-side logic of Premier League Pulse using Django. This role is crucial in ensuring that the data flows efficiently between the database and the frontend, while maintaining security, scalability, and performance. You will design sophisticated database schemas, implement secure user authentication, and expose RESTful endpoints that allow the frontend and external systems to interact with match data, user profiles, and fantasy league features.

Your work directly influences the platform's capability to serve real-time updates and deliver a personalized user experience. You will collaborate closely with the frontend and full-stack developers to integrate backend services with the user interface and ensure seamless communication through APIs.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

### a. Develop and Maintain Server-Side Logic Using Django
- **Implementation**: Write Django views, models, and serializers to manage the business logic.
- **Performance Optimization**: Leverage Django ORM optimally to handle data queries efficiently.
- **Example**: Creating a Django view that fetches real-time match statistics and caches results to reduce database load.

  ```python
  from django.core.cache import cache
  from django.http import JsonResponse
  from .models import Match

  def live_match_stats(request, match_id):
      cache_key = f"match_stats_{match_id}"
      stats = cache.get(cache_key)
      if not stats:
          match = Match.objects.get(id=match_id)
          stats = {
              "score": match.score,
              "possession": match.possession,
              "player_stats": list(match.playerstats_set.values())
          }
          cache.set(cache_key, stats, timeout=60)  # Cache for 1 minute
      return JsonResponse(stats)
  ```

### b. Design Database Schemas and Implement Secure User Authentication
- **Database Design**: Create normalized data models that support functionalities such as user profiles, match results, and fantasy leagues.
- **User Authentication**: Utilize Django’s built-in authentication mechanisms to support secure login and user management.
- **Example**: Configuring a custom user model to enhance authentication security.

  ```python
  from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
  from django.db import models

  class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
      favorite_team = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)
  ```

### c. Build and Document RESTful Endpoints for Data Management
- **API Development**: Develop endpoints that expose robust APIs for data retrieval, submission, and real-time interactions.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that each endpoint is fully documented, outlining input parameters, expected responses, error codes, and usage examples.
- **Example**: Developing an endpoint to retrieve historical match data.

  ```python
  from rest_framework.views import APIView
  from rest_framework.response import Response
  from rest_framework import status
  from .models import Match
  from .serializers import MatchSerializer

  class MatchHistoryAPI(APIView):
      def get(self, request, team_id):
          matches = Match.objects.filter(team__id=team_id)
          serializer = MatchSerializer(matches, many=True)
          return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_200_OK)
  ```

  - Experience with user authentication, authorization, and secure token management.

---

## 4. Deliverables

- **Server-Side Application Code**: Fully functional Django application modules including models, views, serializers, and middleware.
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: Documented endpoints for user authentication, match statistics, player insights, and fantasy league features.
- **Database Schema Designs**: Diagrams and documentation outlining the relational models and data flows.
- **Unit & Integration Tests**: Comprehensive test cases ensuring that backend services are robust, secure, and performant.
- **API Documentation**: Clear and accessible API documentation (e.g., Swagger, API Blueprint) for data exchange with the frontend.

---

## 5. Integration Points

- **Frontend Developer**:
  - Regularly coordinate on API contract specifications to ensure that endpoints meet UI requirements.
  - Provide comprehensive API documentation and sample data responses for the React frontend.

- **Full-Stack Developer**:
  - Collaborate on end-to-end integration tests to ensure that data flows correctly between the backend and frontend.
  - Address cross-functional issues such as session management and error handling.

- **QA Team**:
  - Support the QA team in defining test cases and troubleshooting issues related to API data inconsistency or server errors.
  
- **Project Manager**:
